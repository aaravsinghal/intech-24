        For over two decades, the H.C.E.T Syndicate, an underground spy agency that only a few knew about, has operated in the shadows. Hundreds of agents were part of this organization, carrying out dangerous, life-threatening missions. Their every footstep was defined and tracked by the most secure web platform ever made â€” or so they 
        thought.
A few days ago, NUXE, a team of rival hackers, breached the security system, 
and the whole platform was compromised. Stacks upon stacks of crucial information are 
now on the brink of being vulnerable to attackers. As a result, the platform had to be dissolved.
H.C.E.T Syndicate is in desperate need of a new and improved platform.
